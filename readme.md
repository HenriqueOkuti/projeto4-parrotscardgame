# project4-Parrot Card Game

Front-end app implementation for a memory card game called "Parrot Card Game"

## How to use:

Upon opening you'll be prompted to choose a number of cards to play (4 <= #Cards <= 14).

After selecting the number of cards they'll be placed on the screen. Pick the cards with the same face until you win.

After selecting all cards you'll recieve a prompt with the number of plays you took to win. Note that one pick equals one play, therefore the minimum number of plays you'll take to win is equal to the number of cards you pick.

Do your best!
